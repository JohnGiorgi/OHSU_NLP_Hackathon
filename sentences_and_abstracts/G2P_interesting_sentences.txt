In children with bone marrow relapsed B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia, in multivariate analysis those with mutations in TP53 had worse event-free survival than patients without mutations.
A study of 53 patients with B-CLL found a significant resistance to chemotherapy and corresponding poor clinical outcomes among the 7 treated patients with p53 mutations compared to the 29 treated patients without.

Overexpression and high p-SYK/SYK ratio were associated with resistance to paclitaxel. Inhibition of SYK with R406 resensitized cell lines to paclitaxel.
